Simulation of buffer, H+, OH- and reaction with a single H+ sink and nearby H+ sensor

Diffusion and proton association/dissociation reactions of a discrete number of buffer molecules in a volume of 200nm (X) x 200nm (Y) x 100 nm (Z) was simulated using realistic values for diffusion of buffer, H+ as well as OH- ions (approx. 50000 buffer molecules, and on average 0.25 free protons).Water dissociation was fully taken into account. A single proton sink was used to simulate a vCLC transporter. The protonation state of a pH sensor positioned in close proximity (0.87 nm) with buffer-like H+ reaction kinetics was monitored individually. Dissociation rates of single buffer molecules and the pH sensor were calculated using a second order association rate constant of 1010 M-1 s-1, while association rates were determined empirically using an effective H+/OH- capture radius such that with the chosen time step of 50 ns, and in the absence of transport, the average protonation state of buffer and pH sensor were about 50% (corresponding to a bulk pH of 7). Transport rate was adjusted by selecting an appropriate H+ capture radius of the proton sink. Bulk transport out of the simulated volume was accomplished by replacing “leaving” buffer molecules with bulk-pH protonated ones.
